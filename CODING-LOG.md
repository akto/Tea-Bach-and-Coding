## 2018

- ### 20.01.2018
  - I created [`steamroller.js`](https://github.com/akto/algorithms-problem-solving/blob/master/steamroller.js). JS code to flatten arrays. I started to work on it yesterday but finished tonight. Sometimes I have some difficulties about focusing to the subject that I worked. 

  #### Not to self: 
  - You need to make focusing exercises. 

- ### 17.01.2018
  - I created [`finders-keepers.js`](https://github.com/akto/algorithms-problem-solving/blob/master/finders-keepers.js). JS code to looks through an array (first argument) and returns the first element in the array that passes a truth test (second argument)
  - I created [`drop-it.js`](https://github.com/akto/algorithms-problem-solving/blob/master/drop-it.js). JS code to drop the elements of an array (first argument), starting from the front, until the predicate (second argument) returns `true`.
  - I solved first one yesterday and `drop-it.js` today. They are easy problems.
  #### Pins of the day
  - A pin from yesterday about smallest common multiple solution [`Question about least common multiple problem`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31302054/how-to-find-the-least-common-multiple-of-a-range-of-numbers)

- ### 16.01.2018
  - I have been working on [`smallest-common-multiple.js`]() recently. Instead of using my own solution to this problem, I found a nice solution on [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31302607/2839009). I had used an object to count all repeatable primes. But still can't figure out how I can repeat the divisions. I will keep try to figure it out later.

- ### 15.01.2018
  - I created [`spinal-tap-case.js`](https://github.com/akto/algorithms-problem-solving/blob/master/spinal-tap-case.js). JS code to convert a string to spinal case. Spinal case is all-lowercase-words-joined-by-dashes.
  - Add some functionality to [Pomodoro Clock App](https://codepen.io/egemen/pen/zPzJQp). I tried to make the clock start again after an increase in the session or break amounts. I managed to do it but this time break and session amounts intermixed. So I decided to add an eclectic resetting properity to the application. Now It can be resetted. But clicking creates a new problem. I will look at it later.
  - When I find time, I have been working on the [`smallest-common-multiple.js`](https://github.com/akto/algorithms-problem-solving/blob/master/smallest-common-multiple.js). Decided to create files before I have finished them. Thus I can keep track the changes that I have done and check the thinking process of mine later when I need.
  
- ### 12.01.2018
  - First 12 days of 2018 had a lot of distractions for me. I couldn't code. I need to create a mobile coding environment to use everywhere. Also I need to be ready to these kind of distractions mentally.
  - I am starting to work on a problem which is about [smallest common multiple](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/smallest-common-multiple).

- ### 03.01.2018
  - It's been a week with a lot of distractions. I can't code.
  - I created [`boo-who.js`](https://github.com/akto/algorithms-problem-solving/blob/master/boo-who.js).
  - I guess i will start to code again next week. I am in a vacation that I can't reach the comp easily.

## 2017

- ### 26.12.2017
  - Today I was in the field trip too. I couldn't have time to code when I am in the field.
  - And tomorrow I'll be in the field till the noon or maybe more.
  - Yesterday I was in the field and didn't have access to any computer.
  - I created [`missing-letters.js`](https://github.com/akto/algorithms-problem-solving/blob/master/missing-letters.js). It's a code to find missing letters in a letter sequence in alphabetical order.

- ### 24.12.2017
  - I created [`dna-pairing.js`](https://github.com/akto/algorithms-problem-solving/blob/master/dna-pairing.js). It's code for matching the DNA codes.
  - I watched one video about computer basics.
  - I probably can't make practices for two days. I will be at field trip.
  #### Pins of the day
  - Codrops collective [#376](https://tympanus.net/codrops/collective/collective-376/).
  - Inspirational designs at [uijar.com](https://uijar.com/).

- ### 23.12.2017
  - I created [`pig-latin.js`](https://github.com/akto/algorithms-problem-solving/blob/master/pig-latin.js).
  - I watched one video about computer basics and do one piece of jquery lessons on freecodecamp.
  #### Pins of the day
  - I find a new site about [design princibles](https://principles.design) of various web sites, apps etc...

- ### 22.12.2017
  - I finished 1 video on @freeCodeCamp.
  - I created [`search-and-replace.js`](https://github.com/akto/algorithms-problem-solving/blob/master/search-and-replace.js). JS code to replace provided values with arguments in the sentences. It's a @freeodecamp algorithm challange.
  - I solved an adventofcode challange and create [`advent-sum-of-diff-in-rows.js`](https://github.com/akto/algorithms-problem-solving/blob/master/advent-sum-of-diff-in-rows.js). This script can be used to find accumulation of the sum of differences of max and min values in rows.
  - I'll use `advent-` prefix to indicate the scripts of solutions to [adventofcode.com](http://adventofcode.com) challanges. It's too late for @freeCodeCamp codes. 
  - In js to find the max value of an array. Array.reduce() can be used. When you return a or b in the reduce method it checks every value in the array with elaminate the min one of the two value. Such as -> ( [1,2,3,7,4,5,6] --> (1,2),(2) -> (2,3),(3) -> (3,7),(7) -> (7,4),(7) -> (7,5)(7) ....
   #### Pins of the day
  - Methods that I used today: [`Math.max()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/max) - [`Math.min()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/min)

- ### 21.12.2017
  - I created [`where-art-thou.js`](https://github.com/akto/algorithms-problem-solving/blob/master/wherefore-art-thou.js).
    It's a js code to looks through an array of objects (first argument) and returns an array of all objects that have matching property and value pairs
  - I finished 2 videos on @freeCodeCamp.
  - I solved an algorithm [Sum of the all prime numbers till given value `sum-of-all.js`](https://github.com/akto/algorithms-problem-solving/blob/master/sum-all-primes.js)
  - I finished the [Pomodoro Clock Apps](https://codepen.io/egemen/pen/zPzJQp). It has been challenging for me. Because I had tasks to do in my daily job and gone to the field trips about it. It's very hard to develop something while you are working in a job like that.
  - Maybe I'll seperate background colors of session and break times in the [Pomodoro Clock Apps](https://codepen.io/egemen/pen/zPzJQp) later.
  - Today I can say that I am productive. I solved one algorithm, watched 2 vids, finished the pomodoro clock.
  #### Pins of the day
  - I finished video 6-7-8 at [Computer Basics playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbmfoj2Th9fvxhHIeqFO7wOy)
  - Check out [Dev Tips Video Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyIe-61Y8C4_o-zZCtO4ETQ)
  - Check out to [contribute to the open source projects](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/how-to-contribute-to-open-source)
  - Check out - [The startups of TÃ¼rkiye and which technology they use](https://github.com/frontendistanbul/technologies)

- ### 20.12.2017
  - Today I applied to renew my passport and identity card. It was a busy morning. After that I need to deal with some task in the job.
  - My daily job takes a lot of time of me.
  - So I couldn't code much. But;
  - I solve an algorithm problem from @freeCodeCamp [Sum of all the odd numbers in a fibonacci sequence to given value](https://github.com/akto/algorithms-problem-solving/blob/master/sum-of-all-odd-fibonacci-sequence-to-given-value.js)
  - Create 1 new js file which is a solution to a @freeCodeCamp algorithm and update and edit README.md
  - I almost finished the [pomodoro clock](https://codepen.io/egemen/pen/zPzJQp) but I decided to do it very simple firstly.
    because I need to learn and read more about js objects.
  - After first version I will improve the [pomodoro clock](https://codepen.io/egemen/pen/zPzJQp) eventually.
  #### Pins of the day
  - I like codrops collective. But I first to mention about [30 Seconds of Code](https://github.com/Chalarangelo/30-seconds-of-code). It has very nice code snippets.
  - Today I look up to [Array.reduce() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce) in MDN Web Docs. I used it to sum the only odd values in a fibonacci sequence. 
  - Also I use [Array.pop() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/pop). I just look up to it because of don't make a syntax mistake and be sure about it remove only the last element of the array.
  - Codrops Collective [#374](https://tympanus.net/codrops/collective/collective-374/)
  
- ### 19.12.2017
  - I need to deal with my daily job tasks most of the day again.
  - There is a meeting in the deparment about surveying. But at least I've created this log.
  - I create [`sum-all-numbers-in-a-range.js`](https://github.com/akto/algorithms-problem-solving/blob/master/sum-all-numbers-in-a-range.js)
  - and I update the links in the README.md of Algorithms-problem-solving repository.

- ### 18.12.2017
  - I couldn't code today. Because of my daily job tasks.
